                <h2>About Liesje's Skates</h2>
                <p>
                    The establishment of Liesje’s Skates started with a team full of ambition, passion and care for our environment, which led to the creation of a revolutionary 
                    brand of roller skates. Liesje’s Skates is the first and only brand that manufactures and sells roller skates entirely made out of sustainable materials. 
                    It provides the opportunity for you to lead a more environmentally friendly lifestyle and enjoy the outdoors with a sustainable, yet stylish groove. 
                    Liesje’s Skates represents an inclusive, old school roller skating brand by allowing you to customize your roller skates according to your own style.
                    Liesje’s Skates strives to actively participate in the perseverance of the environment, which is realised by its team of volunteers and employees. 
                    We are proud of our team and partner organisations in their support for our ambitions, and their financial aid in support of our projects, helping to restore 
                    our environment.
                    We aim to involve you, Liesje’s skaters in our projects and activities on our way to a lifechanging sustainable organisation. While we continue to grow and 
                    expand our reach we will take you on a campaign to change roller skating world-wide. We want to change the world, are you ready?
